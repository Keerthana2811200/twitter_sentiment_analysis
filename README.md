Twitter Sentiment Analysis:


This project aims to build a Sentiment Analysis model for Twitter data using Logistic Regression in Google Colab. By analyzing tweet texts, the model classifies each tweet into one of three categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.


## 📌 Project Details

- **Platform**: Google Colab  
- **Dataset**: `twitter_training.csv` (manually uploaded in Colab)
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - re
  - pickle

## 🔁 Workflow in Colab

1. Upload the dataset (`twitter_training.csv`)
2. Clean and preprocess tweets
3. Convert text to numeric using CountVectorizer
4. Train a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Save `sentiment_model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`
7. Use `input()` to test tweet sentiment
8. Download model files for future use
